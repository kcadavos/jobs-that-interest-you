> Notes: Code looks good; site is simple and easy to navigate; Color coordination is nice; I might just suggest already having the link in the Airbnb page already underlined to make the viewer aware that it is a link; I might also suggest doing a hover effect for each of the links on the sidebar just to make the site a bit more dynamic; besides that, everything else is great!
